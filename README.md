# Orchestrator-Airflow-
## Project brief 
This project aims to help with orchestration for the python scripts, from scheduling, logging and centralizing the python scripts in one place instead of being them scattered all around between servers. Moreover, this documentation aims to introduce Apache airflow solution which is an open-source orchestration tool that has the necessary features that we need to manage the python scripts.

These links will describe it more: (I have chosen celery executor as it is easier to start with than kubernetes)
